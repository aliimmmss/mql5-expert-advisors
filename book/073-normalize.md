# Normalize

## Normalization of doubles
The MQL5 API provides a function for rounding floating point numbers to a specified precision (the number of significant digits in the fractional part).
double NormalizeDouble(double number, int digits)
Rounding is required in trading algorithms to set volumes and prices in [orders](</en/book/automation/experts/experts_mqltraderequest>). Rounding is performed according to the standard rules: the last visible digit is increased by 1 if the next (discarded) digit is greater than or equal to 5.
Valid values of the parameter digits: 0 to 8.
Examples of using the function are available in the ConversionNormal.mq5 file.
void OnStart()   
{   
Print(M_PI); // 3.141592653589793   
Print(NormalizeDouble(M_PI, 16)); // 3.14159265359   
Print(NormalizeDouble(M_PI, 8)); // 3.14159265   
Print(NormalizeDouble(M_PI, 5)); // 3.14159   
Print(NormalizeDouble(M_PI, 1)); // 3.1   
Print(NormalizeDouble(M_PI, -1)); // 3.14159265359

Due to the fact that any real number has a limited [internal representation](</en/book/basis/builtin_types/float_numbers>) precision, the number can be displayed approximately even when normalized:
...   
Print(512.06); // 512.0599999999999   
Print(NormalizeDouble(512.06, 5));// 512.0599999999999   
Print(DoubleToString(512.06, 5)); // 512.06000000   
Print((float)512.06); // 512.06   
}

This is normal and inevitable. For more compact formatting, use the functions [DoubleToString](</en/book/common/conversions/conversions_numbers>), [StringFormat](</en/book/common/strings/strings_format>) or intermediate casting to (float).
To round a number up or down to the nearest integer, use the functions MathRound, MathCeil, MathFloor (see section [Rounding functions](</en/book/common/maths/maths_rounding>)).
